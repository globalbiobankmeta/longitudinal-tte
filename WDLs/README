These WDL and json files were initially created to run SAIGE v1.4.0 via Cromwell on the All of Us researcher workbench, but they should be largely generalizable to other biobanks with minor changes.

***NOTE:*** To further parallelize across chunks of chromosomes, use the --rangestoIncludeFile flag to specify the desired range in each call to SAIGE. You might use Cromwell's scatter function to parallelize runs across chunks rather than full chromosomes (see gate_step1_chunked.wdl), or you might parallelize runs across chunks within a multi-CPU VM for each chromosome.
